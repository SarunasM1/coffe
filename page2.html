      <p> The Chemex is a memorable coffee maker, with an elegant glass design and stylish wooden handle. But the benefits of this pour-over device go beyond aesthetics. Keep reading to learn all about this classic coffee maker — and whether you should buy one for yourself.

        Our conclusion? This is a high-quality brewer that both looks nice and works well. You’ll have to buy the right paper filters, but the result is a clean, clear cup — or 10 — of delicious coffee.
        
        There are a few downsides, like the difficulty of cleaning an hourglass-shaped brewer and the somewhat high price point. You’ll also want to consider your coffee preferences, because this paper-filtered brewer isn’t for everyone. But we think this classic pour-over brewer is a great addition to any coffee cabinet!</p>
