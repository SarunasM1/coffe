      <p> The siphon coffee maker is without a doubt the brewer that’s going to make you the center of attention and they certainly create a talking point among customers. This device looks more like a high school chemistry experiment than it does a praised coffee maker.

        But don’t be fooled by its looks, the siphon is regarded as one of the best methods for brewing coffee – that is, once you’ve mastered the ins and outs of how it works, making sure to pay special attention to various brewing variables. Although this coffee maker does require slightly a more hands-on approach and needs a bit more maintenance, the process is enjoyable and the final cup is incredible.
        
        Siphons produce a very clean extraction, which in turn, helps to unlock the flavors hidden deep inside of single-origin coffees.</p>
